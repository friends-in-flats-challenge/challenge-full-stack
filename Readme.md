The project integrates CRUD operations and authentication with email confirmation during registration.
It includes a custom-designed header similar to your website's layout. Upon login,
the header icon dynamically updates to provide options for adding apartments and logging out.
Apartments are displayed on the landing page as cards, fetched from the database after being added through the 'Add Apartment' 
feature. They are arranged in a grid layout with columns organized in a 6x6 format. 
The project also features responsive design for various screen sizes and utilizes three different databases.
